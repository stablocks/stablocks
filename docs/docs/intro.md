# Getting Started

Stablocks seeks to provide an integrated suite of software modules for growing companies and startups. We want to remove the need for managing dozens of different SaaS products. To do this, we have identified common functions used across all businesses and removed the excess to bring the basic core functionality to you. The benefits are great: a single app for all of your services, a shared look and feel across the modules, and integrated data from solution to solution.

## 1. Setup Supabase



## 2. Generate a Netlify site

Deploy a new site from our repo to Netlify with the button below.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/stablocks/stablocks)

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**:

```shell
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and displays your changes.
