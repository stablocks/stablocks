# Introduction

ðŸŽ‰ Welcome to the Stablocks community, we're happy to have you on board! ðŸŽ‰

Stablocks is a project that depends on great developers like you contributing to make the project better for everyone. We cannot build this vision in a bubble, so we didn't! Stablocks is completely open-source to foster improvements and growth far beyond what a small team or even a company could provide.

Our main repo is located at [github.com/stablocks/stablocks](https://github.com/stablocks/stablocks). We welcome any and all [issues](https://github.com/stablocks/stablocks/issues) and [PRs](https://github.com/stablocks/stablocks/pulls) over there. Plus, another awesome way to participate is in our [discussions section](https://github.com/stablocks/stablocks/discussions)!

This documentation was created to be a go to guide for developing for Stablocks. We strive to have great documentation to make the process of developing Stablocks easy and fun. Another great way to contribute is helping with the docs! Spot a mistake? Something unclear? Open an [issue](https://github.com/stablocks/learn/issues) or, better yet, open a [pull request](https://github.com/stablocks/learn/pulls) with a fix!
